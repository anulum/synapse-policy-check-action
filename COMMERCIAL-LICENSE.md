# SYNAPSE CHANNEL — Commercial License

SYNAPSE CHANNEL is **dual-licensed**. You may use it under either:

1. the open-source **GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later** (free — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)), or
2. a **commercial licence** purchased from ANULUM Institute (this document),
   which removes the AGPL's network-copyleft obligation.

You do **not** need a commercial licence if your own software is also released
under the AGPL-3.0 (or a compatible open-source licence). The commercial licence
exists only for **closed-source and SaaS** use, where the AGPL would otherwise
require you to publish your entire stack.

## When you need a commercial licence

The AGPL-3.0 requires that anyone who can interact with a modified version of the
software over a network be offered its complete corresponding source. In practice
you need a commercial licence if **either** of these is true:

- you embed SYNAPSE CHANNEL (the hub, client, or any part of the `synapse_channel`
  package) in a **closed-source** product you distribute, or
- you run it as part of a **hosted / SaaS** service whose source you do not publish.

If both are false — internal use that you never expose over a network to third
parties, research, personal projects, or genuinely open-source software — the free
AGPL-3.0 licence already covers you.

## Tiers

The current tiers, prices (USD), and what each grants are published at
**<https://anulum.github.io/synapse-channel/commercial/>**. In summary:

| Tier | Who it is for | Grant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Community** (free, AGPL-3.0) | OSS, research, personal | full feature set, copyleft applies |
| **Organisation Licence — USD 490/yr** | one legal entity that only needs commercial permission | AGPL-copyleft exemption only; no hosted service, dashboard, SLA, support, or Fleet entitlement |
| **Pro — USD 19/mo or 190/yr** | one developer shipping closed-source products or private hosted services | copyleft exemption for **one** developer, mobile app with push *(planned)*, email support |
| **Team — USD 39/user/mo or 390/user/yr** | a company shipping closed-source or SaaS; minimum 3 seats | exemption for unlimited projects within one legal entity, hosted dashboard *(planned)* while operational data stays local, security-patch SLA, onboarding |
| **FLEET Enterprise — quote** | regulated, multi-hub, or multi-organisation deployments | separately entitled private software with managed federation, SSO, audit exports, compliance support, and a deployment-specific SLA |

Items marked *(planned)* are not available yet; they are not part of what a plan delivers today.

There is **no feature difference** between the open-source and commercial builds.
The package on PyPI *is* the full product; a commercial licence changes only the
**licence terms**, not the code.
SYNAPSE CHANNEL FLEET is a separately entitled private product, not a hidden
commercial build of this repository.

## Grant (commercial tiers)

Subject to payment of the applicable fee and to these terms, ANULUM Institute
grants the purchasing individual or legal entity (the "Licensee") a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use, integrate, and
distribute SYNAPSE CHANNEL **in object or source form as part of the Licensee's
own products and services, without the obligations of AGPL-3.0 sections 13 and
5(d)** (network-use source disclosure), within the scope of the purchased tier.

The Licensee may modify SYNAPSE CHANNEL for its own use; modifications remain the
Licensee's, and no obligation to publish them arises under this commercial licence.

## Conditions

- The grant covers the **version line purchased** and all patch/minor updates the
  Licensee receives during an active term; major-version upgrades follow the tier
  in effect at upgrade time.
- The grant is per the **scope of the tier** (one project, one entity, etc.).
- Redistribution as a **standalone competing coordination bus** is not permitted;
  the grant is for embedding within the Licensee's broader product.
- Attribution and copyright notices in the source must be preserved.

## No warranty

SYNAPSE CHANNEL is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, ANULUM Institute is not liable
for any damages arising from its use. A commercial licence grants licence terms
and the support level of its tier — it is not a warranty of fitness.

## Governing law

These terms are governed by the laws of **Switzerland**, with place of
jurisdiction **St. Gallen**, unless a separately signed agreement states otherwise.

## Contributions

SYNAPSE CHANNEL is authored by ANULUM Institute. Outside contributions are
accepted only under a Contributor License Agreement (or DCO with a relicensing
grant) so that the dual-licensing model remains intact — see `CONTRIBUTING` before
opening a pull request.

## Buy / contact

- Plans and purchase contact: **<https://anulum.github.io/synapse-channel/commercial/>**.
- Custom, OEM, academic, or non-profit terms: **protoscience@anulum.li**.
- For custom evaluation, include the legal entity, product/service name,
  deployment shape, source availability, support expectations, compliance needs,
  and target version line.

agreement, contact us — the signed agreement governs where it differs.*
